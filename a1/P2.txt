Testing aligned access:
 - with both aligned and unaligned addresses of various power-of-two sizes and addresses

Testing get and set:
 - set multiple adjacent 4-byte values and then read those memory locations with get, compare the values

Test Endianness
 - test both directions
 - use integers/arrays with a different value in every byte
 - test with negative bytes values (i.e., a byte value v where v & 0x80 == 0x80)
